# Laser-Intrusion-System




A compact security system designed to protect a valuable item using **three independent sensors** — two LDR-based laser tripwires and one IR proximity sensor. The idea is simple: if *any* of the three sensors detects tampering, the alarm instantly triggers.

## Overview

This system uses **two LDR laser sensors** aimed at fixed points. As long as a laser beam falls on an LDR, it maintains a stable resistance.  
If someone blocks the beam *even for a moment*, the sudden change in resistance is detected and the alarm is triggered.

To make the system fail-proof, an **IR proximity sensor** is mounted directly below the protected object.  
Even if both LDR paths are bypassed or fail, lifting or moving the object activates the IR sensor and rings the alarm.

This three-layer approach makes the system highly reliable for guarding small items, trophies, museum artifacts, or any object that must not be touched.
